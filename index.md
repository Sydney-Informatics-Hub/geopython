The Sydney Informatics Hub (SIH) is a _[Core Research Facility](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities.html)_ of the University of Sydney. Core Research Facilities centralise essential research equipment and services that would otherwise be too expensive or impractical for individual Faculties to purchase and maintain. We provide a wide range of research services to aid investigators, such as:

* [Training and workshops](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/workshops-and-training.html)
* [Project consulting and assistance](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/project-support.html) with Statistics, Data Science, Research Engineering, Bioinformatics, Modeling/Simulation/Visualisation, High Performance Computing.
* [Research data management](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/digital-research-infrastructure.html) consulting and platform support.

We also aim to cultivate a **data community**, organising monthly [Hacky Hours](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/workshops-and-training/hacky-hour.html), outside training events (eg NVIDIA, Pawsey Center), and data/coding-related events. Look out for everything happening on our [calendar](https://www.sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/workshops-and-training/training-calendar.html) or contact us (at sih.info@sydney.edu.au) to get some digital collaboration going.

# Course pre-requisites

No previous programming experience is required, but Session 1 is a pre-requisite for the other sessions. Training will be delivered online, so you will need access to a modern computer with a stable internet connection. Participants are encouraged to setup a Python environment on their local computer (instructions to be provided), but participation using Google Colab will also be supported (Google account required).

# Venue
Participants will be provided with a Zoom link. Trainers will be broadcasting from Sydney.

# Date & Time (in AEST-Brisbane time):	

### Session 1 Python fundamentals
Wed Nov 18, 12:30 pm - 4:30 pm (AEST)
### Session 2 Specialist python libraries and data analysis for geoscience
Wed Nov 25, 12:30 pm - 4:30 pm (AEST)
### Session 3 Pattern recognition and prediction in geoscience
Wed Dec 2, 12:30 pm - 4:30 pm (AEST)
### Session 4 Large data and long running workflow strategies
Wed Dec 9, 12:30 pm - 4:30 pm (AEST)

# Trainers
* Nathaniel (Nate) Butterworth (PhD Computational Tectonics)
* Ben Mather (PhD Computational Geophysics)
* Darya Vanichkina (PhD Bioinformatics, FHEA) 

# Zoom etiquette and how we interact
Everything will be done via zoom. Sessions will be recorded for attendees only, and it is set up to only record the host shared screen and host audio. So please ask embarrassing and stupid questions. We will try and get these uploaded to this site as soon as possible.
Please interrupt when you want! Ideally, have your camera on and interact as much as possible. But we understand it is very easy to check your emails or whatever in the background. 4 hours is a long zoom session so we have got plenty of breaks, some parts are more demo, others are exercises, but most of it will be pretty hands on with everyone writing code. 
We will use Zoom break-out rooms if needed with Darya, Ben, and myself.


# Code of Conduct
We expect all attendees of our training to follow our code of conduct, including bullying, harassment and discrimination prevention policies.

In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours at all our events and on our platforms:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Focus on what is best for the community
* Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

Our full CoC, with incident reporting guidelines, is available at [https://pages.github.sydney.edu.au/informatics/sih_codeofconduct/](https://pages.github.sydney.edu.au/informatics/sih_codeofconduct/)

# General Session Timings

* Start at 12:35pm promptly. 
* 5 min to discuss feedback and summarise previous week.
* 1 hour of content.
* 10 min break.
* 1 hour content
* 10 min break
* 1 hour
* 10 min break
* Until 16:25pm summary + hack session til close. This will be an opportunity to get one-on-one support, or we will deviate from lesson plans if interesting questions arise. If there are particular problems or datasets you would be interested in solving/exploring, email us in advanced and we can either do it as a group (if appropriate) or break out into smaller groups.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Examples come from the discipline of Geoscience.
>
> Setting up your own local Python environment will be most beneficial, however you may also run any of these exampled on remote Python services.
