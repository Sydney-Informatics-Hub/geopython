This episode introduces the [Sydney Informatics Hub](https://informatics.sydney.edu.au/), and puts the Python programming language into context for geoscience.


# The Sydney Informatics Hub

The Sydney Informatics Hub (SIH) is a _[Core Research Facility](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities.html)_ of the University of Sydney. Core Research Facilities centralise essential research equipment and services that would otherwise be too expensive or impractical for individual Faculties to purchase and maintain. The classic example might be the room-size electron-microscopes, built into specialised rooms in the Sydney Microscopy & Microanalysis unit.

**Artemis HPC** itself is a multi-million dollar set of equipment, a 'supercomputer', and is the main piece of equipment supported by SIH. However, we also provide a wide range of research services to aid investigators, such as:

* [Training and workshops](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/workshops-and-training.html)
* [Project consulting and assisstance](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/project-support.html) with Statistics, Data Science, Research Engineering, Bioinformatics, Modeling/Simulation/Visualisation.
* [Research data management](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/digital-research-infrastructure.html) consulting and platform support.

We also aim to cultivate a **data community** at USyd, organising monthly [Hacky Hours](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/workshops-and-training/hacky-hour.html), outside training events (eg NVIDIA, Pawsey Center), and data/coding-related events. Look out for everthing happening on our [calander](https://www.sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/workshops-and-training/training-calendar.html) or contact us (at sih.info@sydney.edu.au) to get some digital collaboration going.

# Course pre-requisites
None. This is an introductory course. The ability to navigate around directories and use a command line is helpful, but we will be working through these tasks. We will learn how to read the manual. We want you to be able to identify what you can automate, then have a set of tools and examples you can copy from to get started, and to know the right terms to search for. We have 16 hours together, which means we will go through almost line-by-line of the examples and discuss the concepts (and potential variations) and justifications for each command and keywrod used.

# Python

Why use Python
Version 2?
Version 3!

You can automate a workflow! 

## How does it compare to...
Other programming languages and tools such as R, Julia, C++, bash, Matlab?

## What is a notebook? What is a terminal?

What is google colab?
How do I get this code working?
What is Docker?
Traditionally, Python was executed in a terminal environemnt.
You have a ***Python Shell*** but now (modelled from Mathematica's Notebooks) you can use a Jupyter Notebook.

## Code of Conduct
Be excellent

## Zoom ettiquette and how we interact
Everything will be done via zoom. Sessions will be recorded for you only. And it is set up to only record the host shared screen and host audio. So please ask embarrassing and stupid questions.
Interrupt when you want!
Ideally, have your camera on and interact as much as possible. But understand it is very easy to check your emails or whatever in the background.
You will hav to follow along to keep up, and the exercises can be demanding.
Break out rooms if needed with Darya, Ben, and myself.
Feedback session. Recap before each one. 30 mins to byo problems?

# Timings

Start at 1:03pm promptly. Discuss feedback and summarise previous week 
1:05. 1 hour + 10 min break
1 hour + 10 min break
1 hour + 10 min break
summary + hack session til close (email in advance.. group exercise.. particular dataset.. or we can schedule a 10 min one-on-one over the 4 weeks).
