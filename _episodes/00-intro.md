This episode introduces the [Sydney Informatics Hub](https://informatics.sydney.edu.au/), and puts the Python programming language into context for geoscience.


# The Sydney Informatics Hub

The Sydney Informatics Hub (SIH) is a _[Core Research Facility](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities.html)_ of the University of Sydney. Core Research Facilities centralise essential research equipment and services that would otherwise be too expensive or impractical for individual Faculties to purchase and maintain. The classic example might be the room-size electron-microscopes, built into specialised rooms in the Sydney Microscopy & Microanalysis unit.

**Artemis HPC** itself is a multi-million dollar set of equipment, a 'supercomputer', and is the main piece of equipment supported by SIH. However, we also provide a wide range of research services to aid investigators, such as:

* [Training and workshops](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/workshops-and-training.html)
* [Project consulting and assisstance](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/project-support.html) with Statistics, Data Science, Research Engineering, Bioinformatics, Modeling/Simulation/Visualisation.
* [Research data management](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/digital-research-infrastructure.html) consulting and platform support.

We also aim to cultivate a **data community** at USyd, organising monthly [Hacky Hours](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/workshops-and-training/hacky-hour.html), outside training events (eg NVIDIA, Pawsey Center), and data/coding-related events. Look out for everthing happening on our [calander](https://www.sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/workshops-and-training/training-calendar.html) or contact us (at sih.info@sydney.edu.au) to get some digital collaboration going.

# Course pre-requisites
None. This is an introductory course. The ability to navigate around directories and use a command line is helpful, but we will be working through these tasks. 

# Python

Why use Python
Version 2?
Version 3!

You can automate a workflow! 

## How does it compare to...
Other tools, R, Julia, C++, bash


Let's get started with some examples....
