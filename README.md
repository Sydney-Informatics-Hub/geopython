# Introduction to Python for Geoscientists
Take your geoscience data management and analysis to the next level with the Python for Geoscience course. Python boasts a rich set of libraries used and developed by geoscientists for working with data. It offers adaptability and versatility to the types of analyses, modelling, and workflows that geoscientists utilise. In this course we will introduce Python foundations integrating geospatial and temporal raster and vector data. We will carry out exploratory, machine and deep learning analyses on these datasets, and demonstrate workflows to go from your local computer to highperformance, cloud, and GPU computing.

## Environment installation and setup

Download this repo which contains all the small datasets and the codes/notebooks we will be using: https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/geopython


## Set up the python environment via Docker
Pull it from [docker hub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/nbutter/repository/docker/nbutter/pyforgeo) or build the [Dockerfile](Docker_details/Dockerfile) and run!

or....

## Create the python environment locally
We need two different environments. One is particularly needed for pyGplates. We are using the conda package manager. If you wish you use your own computer you can download it from https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/ 



# Session 1
This will be a hands-on programming intro. You will learn the basics of coding and Python. If you have experience using command line or some programming language (e.g. Matlab, C++) then you should find this straight-forward. If you have never programmed before, great! This will be the beginning of a great relationship with getting data to do what you want!
