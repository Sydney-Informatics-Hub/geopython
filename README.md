# Introduction to Python for Geoscientists
Take your geoscience data management and analysis to the next level with the Python for Geoscience course. Python boasts a rich set of libraries used and developed by geoscientists for working with data. It offers adaptability and versatility to the types of analyses, modelling, and workflows that geoscientists utilise. In this course we will introduce Python foundations integrating geospatial and temporal raster and vector data. We will carry out exploratory, machine and deep learning analyses on these datasets, and demonstrate workflows to go from your local computer to highperformance, cloud, and GPU computing.

## Environment installation and setup

Download this repo which contains all the small datasets and the codes/notebooks we will be using: https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/geopython

This site in its rendered format is available at: https://sydney-informatics-hub.github.io/geopython/

## Set up the python environment via Docker
Pull it from [docker hub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/nbutter/repository/docker/nbutter/pyforgeo) or build the [Dockerfile](Docker_details/Dockerfile) and run!

or....

## Create the python environment locally
We need two different environments. One is particularly needed for pyGplates. We are using the conda package manager. If you wish you use your own computer you can download it from https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/ 



# Session 1
This will be a hands-on programming intro. You will learn the basics of coding and Python. If you have experience using command line or some programming language (e.g. Matlab, C++) then you should find this straight-forward. If you have never programmed before, great! This will be the beginning of a great relationship with getting data to do what you want!

* [Python Fundamentals](_episodes/01a-fundamentals.md)
* [Python data types and mapping](_episodes/01b-dataframes.md)

# Session 2

Here we will start applying the fundamental Python concepts and tools to solve real world problems.

 * [Machine Learning for classification of economic geology 2](https://github.com/natbutter/gawler-exploration)?
 * [Python data types and mapping](More of Ben's stuff??)

# Session 3

We will explore more advanced data analyis techniques with deep learning.

* [Time Series predictions](_episodes/03a-DeepLearningTS.md)
* [Image Classification](https://github.com/seg/2016-ml-contest/blob/master/LA_Team/Facies_classification_LA_TEAM_05_VALIDATION.ipynb)?
* [Image Classification](https://www.sepm.org/files/172article.912no7rips120nln.pdf)?


# Session 4

The final session will be looking at some more advanced methods for tuning your Python codes and identifying multiple ways of solving the same problem (with vastly different efficiency).
