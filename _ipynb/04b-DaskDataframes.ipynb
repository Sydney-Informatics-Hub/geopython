    "# DASK\n",
    "Dask is a flexible library for parallel computing in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask is composed of two parts:\n",
    "Dynamic task scheduling optimized for computation. This is similar to Airflow, Luigi, Celery, or Make, but optimized for interactive computational workloads. “Big Data” collections like parallel arrays, dataframes, and lists that extend common interfaces like ***NumPy, Pandas, or Python iterators*** to larger-than-memory or distributed environments. These parallel collections run on top of dynamic task schedulers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask emphasizes the following virtues:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Familiar: Provides parallelized NumPy array and Pandas DataFrame objects\n",
    "* Flexible: Provides a task scheduling interface for more custom workloads and integration with other projects.\n",
    "* Native: Enables distributed computing in pure Python with access to the PyData stack.\n",
    "* Fast: Operates with low overhead, low latency, and minimal serialization necessary for fast numerical algorithms\n",
    "* Scales up: Runs resiliently on clusters with 1000s of cores\n",
    "* Scales down: Trivial to set up and run on a laptop in a single process\n",
    "* Responsive: Designed with interactive computing in mind, it provides rapid feedback and diagnostics to aid humans"

There is a trade off between splitting data too much that improves memory management, and the number of extra tasks it generates. For instance, if you have a 1000 GB of data and are using 10 MB chunks, then you have 100,000 partitions. Every operation on such a collection will generate at least 100,000 tasks.
