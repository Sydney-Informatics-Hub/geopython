    "In this session we will show you a few of the basic tools that we can use in Python to make our code go faster. There is no perfect method for optimising code. Efficiency gains depend on what your end goal is, what libraries are available, what method or approach you want to take when writing algorithms, what your data is like, what hardware you have. Hopefully these notes will allow you to think about your problems from different perspectives to give you the best opportunity to make your development and execution as efficient as possible.\n",

    "We will cover a few of the ways that you can potentially speed up Python. As we will learn there are multitudes of methods to make Python code more efficient, and also different implementations of libraries, tools, techniques that can all be utilised depending on how your code and/or data is organised. This is a rich and evolving ecosystem and there is no one perfect way to implement efficiencies.\n",

    "Separate workers or processes acting in an independent or semi-dependent manner. Independent processes ship data, program files and libraries to an isolated ecosystem where computation is performed. In this case communication between workers can be achieved. Contrastingly there are also shared memory set ups where multiple computational resources are pooled together to work on the same data. \n",

    "* Rendering video frames in computer animation.\n",
    "* Open MP implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coarse/Fine-grained parallel:\n",
    "Requires occasional or frequent communication between processors. Uses a small number of processes on large data. Fine grain uses a large number of small processes with very little communication. But can improves computationally bound problems. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some examples are \n",

    "# Python Multiprocessing\n",

    "From within Python you may need a flexible way to manage computational resources. This is traditionally done with the ***multiprocessing*** library. \n",
    "\n",
    "With multiprocessing, Python creates new processes. A process here can be thought of as almost a completely different program, though technically they are usually defined as a collection of resources where the resources include memory, file handles and things like that. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way to think about it is that each ***process runs in its own Python interpreter***, and multiprocessing farms out parts of your program to run on each process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some terminology - Processes, threads and shared memory\n",
    "A ***process*** is a collection of resources including program files and memory, that operates as an independent entity. Since each process has a seperate memory space, it can operate independently from other processes. It cannot easily access shared data in other processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A ***thread*** is the unit of execution within a process. A process can have anywhere from just one thread to many threads. Threads are considered lightweight because they use far less resources than processes. Threads also share the same memory space so are not independent.\n",

    "Back to python, the multiprocessing library was designed to break down the **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** that limits one thread to control the Python interpreter. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the things that are occurring simultaneously are called by different names (thread, task, process). While they all fall under the definition of concurrency (multiple things happening anaologous to different trains of thought), only multiprocessing actually runs these trains of thought at literally the same time. We will only cover multiprocessing here which assists in CPU bound operations - but keep in mind other methods exist (threading), whose implementation tends to be more low level. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple multiprocessing example\n",
    "\n",
    "Some basic concepts in the multiprocessing library are:\n",
    "1. the ```Pool(processes)``` object creates a pool of processes. ```processes``` is the number of worker processes to use (i.e Python interpreters). If ```processes``` is ```None``` then the number returned by ```os.cpu_count()``` is used.\n",
